# Seven Segment AI

This project demonstrates how a neural network learns to recognize the readings from a seven-segment display.

## Introduction

This demonstration project was created to illustrate the learning process of a neural network used for recognizing
digits displayed on a seven-segment display. The goal is to provide a clear and visual explanation of how machine
learning can be applied in real-world applications.

## Technologies

The following technologies were used to implement the project:

- Vue.js - A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and convenient styling.
